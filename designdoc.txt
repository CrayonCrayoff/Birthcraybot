            [x] Just use a separate script for this?


[ ] Set up logic
    [x] refuse to work if shoutout channel is not set
    [x] check if bot has access to designated shoutout channel?
    [ ] periodically check if shoutouts are needed
        [ ] check by birthday and calculate a good time?
        [ ] OR pick a fixed time (like noon UTC)?  <--- probably easier
    [ ] trigger for when someone leaves the server and remove their birthday from the database?
    [ ] When bot is removed from a guild, prune database automatically?
